# Sales and Road Accident Analysis-Dashboard



## Problem Statement

The current lack of integrated analytics for sales performance and road accident data is hindering our ability to make informed decisions that could enhance both revenue generation and public safety. Sales teams struggle to access real-time insights on performance metrics due to fragmented data sources, while stakeholders analyzing road accidents face similar challenges with disparate data, making it difficult to identify trends and correlations. This disconnect not only impedes strategic planning for sales initiatives but also limits our understanding of how road safety impacts sales operations in certain regions. Developing a unified dashboard that consolidates sales and road accident data will enable us to uncover critical insights, optimize sales strategies, and enhance safety measures, ultimately driving growth and improving community welfare.
